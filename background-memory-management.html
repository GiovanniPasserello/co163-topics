      <h1>Memory Management and ASLR</h1>
      <p>
        Both the Meltdown and Spectre attacks allow attackers to leak information from memory. Meltdown in particular allows an attacker to read a machine's entire kernel memory, bypassing techniques
        aimed at preventing processes from accessing memory locations which should not be able to be accessed<sup><a href="#1">[1]</a></sup>. This section explains memory management in more detail.
      </p>
      <h2>Virtual Memory</h2>
      <p>
        In modern computers, a common memory management technique is the concept of virtual memory, where programs are assigned their own virtual address space and interact with the physical memory
        via virtual addresses<sup><a href="#2">[2]</a></sup>. This abstraction layer provides several benefits where the responsibility of sharing a limited amount of physical memory with other
        processes is delegated to the
        operating system.
      </p>

        <figcaption class="figure-caption">Fig. 1: Model of page-frame mapping</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        For virtual addressing to work, physical memory is divided into consecutive blocks called frames, and virtual memory is formed of pages, which are fixed-length contiguous blocks of virtual
        memory which map to frames. Each process is assigned a page table, a data structure which contains the physical memory mappings. Additionally, page tables contain security-related properties
        such as whether a virtual memory region is read-only, accessible from user/kernel mode (discussed later) or executable<sup><a href="#3">[3]</a></sup>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The main security benefit of virtual addressing is that processes cannot access the virtual address space of other processes. If processes could directly interact with physical memory in user
        mode with insufficient protection from the operating system, they would be able to access memory of other processes, allowing malicious processes to view sensitive data. This process isolation
        is enforced with a special CPU register which stores the address of the current process' page table<sup><a href="#4">[4]</a></sup>.
      </p>
      <p>Additionally, isolating processes in virtual memory complements the concept of user mode and kernel mode, where each user mode process is given its own virtual address space, whereas the
        kernel shares a single virtual address space. Additionally, processes in user mode cannot access kernel memory directly; instead they must call public APIs exposed by the kernel (system calls)
        <sup><a href="#5">[5]</a></sup>.</p>
      <p>To improve the performance of virtual addressing, the memory management unit contains the translation lookaside buffer (TLB)<sup><a href="#4">[4]</a></sup> which operates as a cache for
        recent translations from
        virtual to physical memory. The issue with keeping this cache is that a process can switch between user mode and kernel mode repeatedly as system calls are made, causing the TLB to be flushed
        and reloaded by reading the page table of the mode being entered. As a result, the kernel is loaded at a predefined position of every user mode process, relying on the properties of the page
        tables and a processor's supervisor bit<sup><a href="#6">[6]</a></sup> to determine whether the kernel can be accessed.</p>

        <figcaption class="figure-caption">Fig. 2: Visualisation of physical memory being mapped into <br/>kernel-space of a process (blue represents a chunk of memory)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Most importantly in the context of Spectre and Meltdown, as the kernel may need to access user memory, operating systems such as Linux and OS X map the entire physical memory into a
        predefined virtual address in kernel address space so that the kernel can access the memory it needs<sup><a href="#4">[4]</a></sup>.</p>
