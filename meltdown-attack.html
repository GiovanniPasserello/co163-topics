      <p>There are two parts to carrying out a Meltdown attack<sup><a href="#1">[1]</a></sup>. The first part consists of making the CPU execute one or more instructions that would otherwise never
        occur in the executed path
        (transient instructions), e.g. access an address the instruction should not have access to. The second part is making sure the microarchitectural state change is carried forward to create an
        architectural state change, and thus the data be accessed from there.
      </p>
      <p>When an instruction is fetched, it will first be scheduled to be read<sup><a href="#2">[2]</a></sup> then pipelined<sup><a href="#3">[3]</a></sup> by the CPU, with the privilege check
        occurring later, which may not in parallel. The effect of not
        having the privilege check occur in parallel means that the attacking application can be forked before accessing the memory location that causes the privilege check to fail, and as such ensure
        that the prohibited memory address the transient instruction is trying to read, is going to be read regardless of the privilege check passing or failing<sup><a href="#4">[4]</a></sup>.
      </p>

      <p>By doing this process out of order, the results aren’t retired as it will eventually fail the privilege check, thus allowing the architectural state to roll-back to a previous state<sup><a
          href="#1">[1]</a></sup>.
        However there are severe microarchitectural side effects. This is where we delve into the second part of this attack.
      </p>

      <p>If a part of the instruction depends on reading an unauthorised address, that piece of information will still be read (as that is what the functional unit was told to do for that part of the
        overall instruction.) Although, if this piece of information is read, the sensitive data is never seen by the register unit, due to the failure of the privilege check. However, as the
        instruction has already read the key data it should not have access to, by reading the memory, the information is also updated to the CPU cache as part of a normal memory recall<sup><a
            href="#5">[5]</a></sup>.
      </p>

      <p>This means that whilst the instruction execution is abandoned and thus its results discarded, the sensitive data it managed to call during the execution process is now available in the cache.
        Although all the information at that address isn’t put onto the CPU cache, the part that was called for the instruction to progress is still there, as preparation for future recall of this
        data; this can then be exfiltrated by attackers via a side channel attack to read the part of the contents of the prohibited address (usually via flush + reload)<sup><a href="#6">[6]</a></sup>.
      </p>

      <p>The implications of this method means that any part of the physical memory can be effectively retrieved within a short period of time, i.e. attackers can read every address of interest with
        great efficiency<sup><a href="#1">[1]</a></sup>.
