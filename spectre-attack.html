          The Spectre Attacks are a class of computer attacks which leverage speculative
          execution to execute programs in incorrect ways, rendering measurable side effects.
          These incorrect processes were assumed to have no security implications due to the
          processor rollback methods, however recent research suggests otherwise. Spectre attacks
          involve inducing a victim to speculatively execute operations that would not occur
          during correct execution of the program and which may leak the victim’s private data
          via a microarchitectural covert side channel attack to the adversary – predominantly
          using Flush and Reload techniques. The problem with reverting back to a checkpoint
          after erroneous speculative execution is that changes to certain parts of the CPU -
          such as cache contents -  may subsist the state reversion.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
          An example of exploitable code is as follows:
        </p>
        <pre><code>
          <i>
    if (x < array1_size)
          y = array2[array1[x] * 256];
          </i>
        </code></pre>
      <br/>
      <p>
        In the above example, the attacker-controlled variable, x, is checked to be within a legal
        range to ensure the access to array1 is valid. If the value of x is valid then the succeeding
        statement may run, otherwise the program shouldn’t be allowed to access that section of
        array2.
      </p>
      <br/>

        <figcaption class="figure-caption"><i>Figure 1</i>: Shows private and accessible sections of memory</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <br/>
      <p>
        In order to exploit this, the attacker will first train the Branch Predictor to take the
        branch by invoking the code with valid inputs multiple times so that it will begin to
        speculatively execute the branch; this will cause array1_size to be uncached and array1
        to become cached. The attacker will then invoke the code with an invalid value of x and
        reading array1_size will result in a cache miss, causing a substantial delay until the
        value is available from main memory. During this delay, the processor will begin to
        speculatively execute the branch and read the value of array1[x] resulting in a cache hit,
        quickly returning the value of a secret byte, k. The processor will request a read from
        array2[k * 256] which will result in another cache miss. The value of array1_size then
        returns from memory whilst the read from array2 is pending. The processor will realise that
        the speculative execution was erroneous and the program is reverted back to the checkpoint,
        however the change in cache state is not reverted.
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to recover the secret byte, k, from cache, the attacker may launch a side channel
        attack to detect a change in the cache state. Alternatively the attacker may request a read
        from array2[k’ * 256] with a range of values of k’; the value of k’ = k will result in a
        cache hit, meaning the attacker can observe the short return time using a timer and obtain
        k. The value of array2[k * 256] can then be read to gain access to the victim’s private
        memory.
      </p>

      </figure>
      <br/>
      <p>
        Aside from general exploitation within a program, this data leakage can also be used
        directly; for example, a malicious JavaScript in a browser could steal passwords stored in
        the browser from another tab. The potential impact of this exploitation could be drastic if
        employed by ‘real-world’ attackers.
