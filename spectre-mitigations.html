      <h2>Mitigations</h2>
      <p>
        According to the original website devoted to Spectre and Meltdown, Spectre “is not easy to
        fix, it will haunt us for quite some time”, although according to DELL computers, “No
        ‘real-world’ exploits of these vulnerabilities have been reported to date (February 7,
        2018), though researchers have produced proof-of-concepts”. In the long term it seems likely
        that Meltdown will be a thing of the past, wholly mitigated, however Spectre is going to be
        around for a much longer time till fully patched.
      </p>
      <p>
        It would be possible to simply disable speculative execution however this would yield a
        significant performance penalty, therefore affected companies have worked on patches
        prioritising minimal performance drops. Many of these patches have reported benchmark
        performance drops of 2-14% on average on eighth-generation Core platforms and many were
        unsuccessful, causing frequent random reboots and crashes. There are three patch approaches:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Browser:</b><br/>
          <p>
            Browsers are particularly at risk to Spectre as it is rather simple to write JavaScript
            to perform an attack and steal personal information such as passwords; this can also
            provide data useful for breaking out of browser sandboxes.
          <br/>
            High-resolution timers are used by JavaScript for means of benchmarking, however Spectre
            attackers may utilise this in a side channel timing attack. To protect against Spectre,
            most major browsers such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari and Microsoft Edge
            have reduced the resolution of the JavaScript timers from a granularity of 5 to 20
            microseconds in order mitigate the effects of a timing attack. Some browsers have also
            reduce the timer accuracy by introducing up to 20 microseconds of random jitter in its
            results; this approach is called time-fuzzing.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li><b>Google:</b><br/>
          <p>
            Google have said that Spectre “doesn’t have any clean, simple fix… Spectre is going to
            require careful examination of, and repair to, vulnerable applications”. On January 4,
            2018, however, Google detailed a new technique on their security blog called “Retpoline”
            (return trampoline) which is said to mitigate the effect of Spectre with negligible
            processor overhead. Retpoline is a software construct for preventing
            branch-target-injection which allows indirect branches to be isolated from speculative
            execution so that illegal data access will not occur. This is primarily achieved by
            using return operations which figuratively ensures that any associated speculative
            execution will “bounce” endlessly.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li><b>Intel:</b><br/>
          <p>
            Intel has recommended inserting a serializing instruction (Intel chose to use lfence
            however there are others) in code between the conditional array bound check and
            accessing the array. This would prevent speculative execution as every instruction that
            appears before the serializing instruction must be completed until the serializing
            instruction can be executed. This would mean that the array bound check would have been
            definitively calculated before the array is ever accessed; this would mean that no parts
            of the array would have illegal access. This technique obviously comes with a
            significant performance drop, so programmers should be careful in the insertion of
            serializing instructions inserting them only where private data may be involved.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These above issues, alongside many other factors, simply underline the complexity of Spectre
        and the fact that a definitive patch is not so trivial. The computing community and wider
        world may have to deal with this vulnerability for a long time yet, until a concrete
        solution is found.
